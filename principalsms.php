                    “Education is not the amount of information that is put in your brain, we want that education by
                    which character is formed, strength of mind is increased, the intellect is expanded by which one can
                    stand on one’s own feet”. <br />

                Thus education is not merely acquisition of information or skills but transformation of information into
                knowledge and knowledge into wisdom that leads to Character building and holistic development of
                personality of an individual. It is training in citizenship. It is a process of sowing within the
                individual seeds of values, of simplicity, and service and helping him/her to blossom into a beautiful
                human being. It is with this aim of building a better tomorrow by creating socially sensitive and
                responsible citizens of character and integrity New Ideal Convent School & College, provides every platform to its students
                to explore, to discover, to create, and to grow into original thinkers, innovative scientists, creative
                artists, preservers of nature and above all the finest human beings who will serve their country and the
                world. <br>

                My dear students, becoming aware of this social scenario, let us take upon ourselves this challenge of “
                Achieving Excellence Together” and enter into this temple of education with enthusiasm in our spirits,
                determination in our hearts, courage in our mind and readiness to strive harder. Let the education that
                is imparted in this temple of learning broaden our perspective, widen our horizon, deepen our insight
                and liberate us from narrow and negative thinking and help us to evolve as better human beings, to
                create a better world.
